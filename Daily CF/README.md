Daily CF is my very first solo project — a Chrome extension built to make Codeforces practice simpler, more consistent, and a little more engaging. The motivation was straightforward: competitive programming demands daily effort, but often we spend more time searching for problems than actually solving them. Daily CF automates this process.

What It Does:

1. Let's you save your Codeforces username and view your profile details directly in the popup (name, rank, profile picture).
2. Tracks solved problems and shows a running count, along with your maximum streak.
3. Recommends fresh unsolved problems daily, filtered by rating range. Beginners (0–700) receive problems slightly above their level (800–900), while more experienced users get problems matched to their skill.
4. Ensures variety by choosing problems from the last three years only, keeping practice relevant and updated.
5. Supports both light and dark modes for a comfortable interface.

6. Provides an option to clear data and reset the extension anytime.

Why It Matters:
The extension is designed to save time and encourage regular practice. By offering curated unsolved problems directly in the browser, it removes the common hurdle of decision fatigue. The goal is to make problem-solving a daily routine rather than a scattered effort.

A Small Request:
As this is my first solo project, I warmly invite my friends, seniors, and juniors to try Daily CF. Please explore its features, use it in your practice, and let me know if you find any bugs or areas for improvement. Your feedback will be invaluable in shaping the next version.
