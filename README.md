# Extensions

This repository is a collection of my Chrome extension projects.  
It serves as a space where I experiment, learn, and share tools that I build along the way.

I am creating these extensions while completing my graduation at **Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST)**. The work here reflects both my academic journey and my growth as a Software Engineering student, combining curiosity with practical coding experience.

## Vision

The purpose of this repository is to:

-   Explore new ideas in extension development.
-   Build useful tools that solve real-world problems.
-   Document and share my learning process as I grow.

I see this repo not just as a code archive, but as a record of my development journey during my time at SUST.

## Contribution & Feedback

Feedback, suggestions, and collaboration are always welcome.  
If you notice issues or have ideas for improvement, feel free to open an issue or reach out.

## Future Plans

-   Continue adding new extensions as I learn and explore.
-   Refine and improve existing projects.
-   Provide clear documentation for each extension.

Stay tuned â€” more projects will be added soon!
